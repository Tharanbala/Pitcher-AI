At this price range, it's an excellent choice for anyone looking for a budget-friendly 4K UHD TV. Now, let's dive into the TV's dimensions. It weighs approximately 23 pounds and has the following dimensions: 11.8 x 48.7 x 30.4 inches. These measurements make it a perfect fit for most entertainment setups, whether you're placing it on a stand or mounting it on a wall. Here are the top pros of the TCL 55\\\" Class 4-Series 4K UHD Smart Roku TV: 1. **Stunning Picture Quality:** Enjoy vivid colors and enhanced clarity with the TV's stunning 4K UHD picture quality, which has four times the resolution of Full HD. 2. **HDR Technology:** The TV's High Dynamic Range (HDR) technology provides bright and accurate colors, making the viewing experience lifelike and engaging. 3. **Easy Voice Control:** Manage the TV effortlessly using popular voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Hey Google.
